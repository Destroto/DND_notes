Published by: [[Idris]]

After yet another night of swindling drunkards and salors alike in the land locked lumbering village of [[Vaalinkas]], unknowingly the mighty [[Idris]] was about to have a chance encounter that would forever change his life. One simple title, [[The Party]].












After an expert translation, that surely I could have done if I had a little bit of time, we were pulled in through a firey hole in the sky.

Once we got our wits about us, some nasty Kobald fucks began to jump this mother and her child. Which if you know us, that doesn't fly without spilling some of your own blood in turn. Letting them know exactly what I think of 'em, I laid one of them fuckers out cold with a right arrow between the soul gates (eyes).

After a vailiant fight, and many a slain Kobald. We learn we have laid foot in a town called [[Greenest]], which is under seige by a cult with the destructive power of a Dragon.



Elva's account, "So basically we go up to the Dragon with a suggestion... Leave. We then talked with him, and he was all like 'nah'. We then gave the Dragon a painting of my Lizard, and he loved it! So he left peacefully."

After this occurance... I was left is a mindless stupor, from my wreched trudge through the sewers. I need a drink... or 74.
