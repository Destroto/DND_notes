Worships [[Tiamat]] and has been found around [[Greenest]]

Two of the cultists were found within a cave within the [[Raiders Camp]]. After a stunning feat of strength from yours truly, we were able to coorce one of the cultists to spill valuable information as to who they... and their master is.

Their business in [[Greenest]] is to cultivate a horde to attract dragons.
