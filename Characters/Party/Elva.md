Elva is a female elf bard. She loves to tell stories and sing while playing her violin. With her
shes got her trusted companion Talith the Salamander. Together they travel from town to town
spreading joy and trying to fullfill her promise to her deceased mother to never let her be
forgotten. Since losing everything she had at a very young age, she has a hard time opening
up and letting people in. But once she's opened up she is the most kind, loving friend you could
have. She's got a big heart and tries to do the right thing, even if it might not be done in
the most conventional way.

When Elva was young her mother told her a lot of fairytales which evoked her love for
telling stories. Her mom loved music and taught her how to play the violin at a very young age.
One day Elva finds her moms old journal from when she was out adventuring and learns that she used to be a bard. In the book are a lot of stories she remembers from fairytales she told and songs her mother had written. One day she takes her violin and the book and sneaks out to the woods to practice one of the songs to surprise her mom. After a while she hears fighting from the village and runs back. She sees her mom who yells at her to run. She ran and hid in the woods, after a while she
sneaks back to the village only to find it completely destoryed by the raiders. She gives her parents
a proper burial and makes a silent vow to share her mothers stories so that she's never be forgotten.
She moved on to another bigger town and survived by stealing, playing the violin and telling stories
(because of this she got good at dissapearing in crowds and hiding in plain sight). As she got
older she started to travel more and survived purely by playing the violin at taverns and in the
town square.
