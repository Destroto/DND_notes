Growing up Monikin was a social outcast and an introvert, he didn't fit in or have any friends. He didn't even get along with his family as his parents only ever cared about his older brother and his many accomplishments, he was seen as disappointment compared to him. 

Because of this Monikin ran away to live in the forest in hopes of starting a new life for myself where Monikin wouldn't have to deal with the people who think little of him. 

While trying to survive in the forest Monikin met a wood elf named Sylvanas who eventually took him in as her son. She also lived in woods and taught Monikin everything she knows. She had taught him the basics of archery and how to hunt, this was important because she was self-sufficient and never needed to go into the the towns for anything. They had always stayed together in her hut. 

Recently she's gotten very sick and Monikin needs to get her the medicine she needs to stay healthy but can't afford it because he doesn't have any form of currency since he's never left the forest. Because of this Monikin finally needs to go back into society to try to earn enough money to keep her safe.
