Undella is a young human who was abandoned by their parents when they were young. They were taken in by a group of thieves led by three older women. Being raised as a thief has made them act out on their own, doing whatever they wanted. Their caretakers, who Undella has come to see them as older sisters, loosely raised Undella which caused them to develop a sense that the only people they can rely on are themselves and their imagination. (Though Undella still looks highly towards their sisters.) Undella has come to conceal their gender and age to help fit in among the thieves. They always wear a dark baggy cloak. While traveling, they report back to camp and their sisters every once in a while. Undella has worked their way up the ranks where they are now seen as being around the sisters level. This has boosted Undellas ego and has demanded everyone call them “Undella the Elite” because “Undella the Great'' sounds too stereotypical. Undella has relied on their imagination and even though they are a good person at heart, they see everyone has an enemy and has never been able to make friends even with other thieves, their annoying little kid personality does not help with that either.
