![[Melian_card.jpg]]

Melian was born as a half elf from her drow mother and human father. 
Her mother fell in love with a soldier that came travelling through their village. 
She ended up being pregnant. The soldier left without any intention to come back so she had to raise Melian by herself. 
She loved her very much though so she gave her the name Melian meaning dear gift. 

Because of her human blood Melian's skin tone ended up being way lighter than that of the other drows in the village. She never really fitted in even though her mum tried to shield her from the hate of the neutral evil drows. 
When her mother falls ill, Melian has to helplessly watch. No one in the drow settlement was willing to help her or her mother. She eventually dies with Melian at her side. 

Without her loving mother Melian struggles a lot in the village. 
One day a traveling paladin passes through the settlement. Melian is instantly impressed and mesmerised by his caring nature and selflessness. They end up talking for a while. He senses her potential and offers her to train her as a paladin. She instantly agrees to travel with him, happy to finally leaving her village. 
The next years she spends travelling and training to become a paladin as well. 
After her training is complete her master gifts her her first full set of armor and sees her off on her own travel adventure.
Melian has a messenger bird named Peregrine.
