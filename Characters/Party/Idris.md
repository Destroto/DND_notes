You'd imagine that to a young Halfling growing up that heritage is important, of that you'd be 100 percent correct. That is the case with Idris. Coming from a long line of con-men and all around slippery weasels, their line has no name and that would put an end to their fun all too soon. Though they have no name, since the moment there were more than one they have referred to themselves as the Teaghlach ( /chye-lukh/) . Taking others by surprise is the aim, simply for the fun of it. In this family, the only sense of naming convention is that the new born be named after the "amadán mór" (the amadán mór being the person they pulled the biggest trick on) of their dominant parental figure.

The name Idris would simply come from the name of Guldren's (named after the fat old dwarf who's plunder was that of a golden spoon) amadán mór, Idris Roven, an elven study of archane arts. After being cheated out of simply a blank book, Idris was through with the fool's act and returned to his study. About to chalk the day as a loss, Guldren thought that he could at least use the book to keep track of his spoils. Writing in yesterday's plunder of 12 bronze coins, it was then that he noticed the book would not take to his ink, nor any other substance he carried. Thinking this as clearly the most valuable object he would ever possess, he wrote into the inner lining of his coat the name of Idris as to recall his name and continue their heritage once he had kin of his own.

Now a young adult and able to fend for himself, Idris seeks to make a mark on who will ultimately will become his amadán mór. When, where, and who are all questions with answers so far away that he might as well enjoy the time in between, which is precisely what he does.
