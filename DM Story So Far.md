The party, a band of closely bonded adventurers, stumbles upon an artifact during an escapade in dungeoneering. Trapped in a room with a glowing, floating crystal above a pedestal covered in runes and markings, they brace. All goes white. They come to on the side of a frozen mountain. The party then begins to explore, quickly learning the challenges this wild landscape will present them with as they find themselves facing a pack of wild wolves. through quick witted judgement, Elva weaves a spell to communicate with the wolves. The party is spared and backs off. As they travel deeper into this unknown landscape, they find they need to cross a river to proceed in the direction they have chosen. Unfortunately, all hell breaks loose as the party finds themselves clinging to one another and quickly racing down the icy river. Only a fallen tree saves them as they clasp onto it for dear life. They survive yet another challenge. They quickly happen upon a shack filled with notes on the land and it's dangers. Of note is many references to a "horror" lurking in these mountains. The house seems strangely abandoned, as if in haste, or as if the inhabitants merely vanished. Curious, the party proceeds across another river, not without renewed difficulty, and eventually finds their way to the opposite mountain top, where they discover an open air ruin. They begin to hear noises and sense danger however, and elect to scour the surrounding area for more information or people. Finally, they return to the mountain peak they began on and search for clues. They find a door leading into the mountain-side and head deep into the dark. Quickly, they reach a turn and find themselves in a small room. As they begin to investigate, they light a torch and find themselves attacked by a living shadow.

Dealing with the shadow, the party searches the room and finds a paneled wall. Solving the puzzle in the wall, the party hears stone grinding. Cautiously, they head back and find a new path opened in the hall. Following it, they find a room akin to the one that brought them to this place, along with a library space and table with notes. Searching these, the party learns of a summoning gone wrong and the way to reverse it. The party pauses and makes up their minds: they will confront the monster in the wilds. Heading to the ruins on the mountainside, they begin to ponder how to go about this challenge. Eventually, they choose to take the risk and cast the ritual. Upon preparing, the party hears the strange sing-song howling of the creature. The creature seems amorphous and visually resembles a blur of shadows and features that you can't quite understand or verify as true or illusory. The party combats the beast until the ritual can be completed. Finally, with an inhuman screech, the creature is pulled into the spell, a massive rift in the sky, appearing similar to a mirage. The party has succeeded. _**BUT, THAT'S JUST A CAMPAIGN! A DND CAMPAIGN!**_ _Thanks for playing..._

After besting the faceless horror, the party assessed their position. After some time, they found that there were two villages down the mountain, one larger than the other. They chose to go to the larger of the two in order to find information. Climbing their way down the mountain and meandering across the plains, eventually they make their way into town. Quickly, they locate an inn and tavern, making their way in and asking for some basic meal and drink. Here they find an interesting halfling running a game of chance. It was a simple game of cards and was meant to be a test of one's ability to pay attention, or one's luck. Yet, despite this, he was winning every time. The party walked up and enquired about him, even challenging him to a game. After a loss, they invited the stranger to their table. This stranger was Idris, a simple traveler and halfling, at least so he seemed. After probing him for some information (and inconspicuously adopting him into the party), everyone went to visit the market square. Due to the time, most things were closed, but a man in blue robes caught the character's eyes. This man was Denton Aftershire, groundskeeper for the House of Tynai. This man takes interest in the party and a conversation emerges. The party ends up enlisting his help with deciphering the symbols on the gemstone. This results in a rough translation but not enough for the party to practically use. A concession is made that they can return in the morning and make a request of the high priest. (edited)

The next morning, the party opts to split up: Melian and Concordia will go to the church and Monikin, Idris, and Elva will go to the market. The group that went to the market purchased healing items from some of the clergy of Tynai, marked by their blue robes. After this transaction, they began to make their way to the thin smoke trails just out of town, presumably nomadic tribes. Meanwhile, the group that went to the church arrived during a prayer service. After some time, the service ended and they got connected to the head priest, who took them down into the library under the church. Here, he began to translate the runes. Before this was completed, the high priest realized these travelers were from much farther than a few towns over. He explained they seem to have been brought here from a teleportation stone that was made by an ancient civilization that used to hold the mountain-tops. Here, the high priest stops and requests to see Melian's talisman. Comparing it to his own, it seems the two of them worship very similar gods; Selûne and Tynai are both gods of stars and the mind, represented with eyes and stars. After this, the man finishes the translation and asks the party to stay quiet on their origins. Returning to those going to the nomadic tribe, they made it to the encampment and enquired if the elder knew of their home. Upon receiving a no, they learned of the mystics. The mystics possess the ability to communicate telepathically, and were asked to request about the sword coast. After this, the party returned to the tavern. Elva took the opportunity to perform, in hopes of making some money to cover the party's tab. After the eventful day and well orchestrated night, the party recapped all they learned and resolved to find their way home. _**BUT THAT'S JUST A CAMPAIGN!

Joining the nomadic tribe they had befriended, the party farewelled the town they had been in and began their journey to the college of magic. Against their will, the party is joined by Denton. Over the course of the day they crossed a fast-flowing river and settled outside a village. While at the village they found a pub and chose to take rest. Elva requested and gained permission to perform for the patrons, finding the room receptive to her melody and earning a little coin for her efforts. Melian took this time to approach the bartender, Charles Dumortier, and ask about the area. She learned the town they were heading for was known as Mivwe-en, part of the Eshpiik empire, the stronghold of the orcs. Additionally she was warned of a dangerous monster south of the village, the demonic D'tenebris. Suddenly a man with squared shoulders and a strong mustache approached. He posed mildly invasive questions and seemed to carry a presence. This man was later discovered to be the head of the local militia, Peret Mesòn. His history with the nomads, and possibly other travelers, seemed a sore topic when inquired. Following this, Monikin decided to try his luck at getting his hands on some alcohol, much to the distaste of Elva, who halted her performance to drag him out of the bar. Ultimately, the party left shortly after this and headed towards the temple to Helmere. Inside was an elaborately carved altar and relief statues showing a female and a male figure, carrying a sickle and a head of wheat respectively. Denton explains this as the two forms of the deity, the spring and fall versions. The party thanks him out of respect then leaves, whereupon they learn that the tribe they are travelling with, the Yemnek have given them tents. This is explained by their leader, Fien Renston. The next day, they travel with little difficulty and make camp outside of a dense forest. (edited)

    Forgetting the warning from the day before, the party found themselves deeper in the woods than advised, staring down an unknown attacker and the arrows being fired at them. The party fought back, setting fire to the treetops. As the fire began to spread in earnest, their attacker, a weretiger of immense strength, yielded under the condition that the fire could be put out. Accepting this, the party watched as the weretiger, Trmin Nemos, summoned a localized rain to put out the blaze. Accepting defeat, and grasping at a feint hope, he inquired about the healing abilities of Melian. Ultimately, Melian and Monikin were tasked with healing his daughter, the person he was trying to protect, Magdaline. They worked together to find healing herbs and concoct a medicine followed by Melian's healing magic. Afterwards, they investigated the strange home the weretigers lived in, ruins left over from the ancient elvish culture that the party is investigating. While unsure of what the ruins are from, they are led to a pillar that has damaged text, with the readable line being "ya huzhed narim saungedai" - "the secret in the trees." From this, Magdaline coined the name Saungerim. During this, Elva, Concordia, and Idris returned to the camp where they are intercepted by Fien. They explain what occurred and are advised to say it was an animal attack, as Trmin may be D'tenebris. The party accepts this. Once Melian and Monikin return to camp, all party members exchange information and rest, hearing the increasingly chaotic and unbelievable rumors and guesses as to what caused the fire in the woods. The next day, the party traveled a tad more and decided to head over the mountain to get to the city in the sand. As they prepared they wondered what challenges they would face next. BUT THAT'S JUST A CAMPAIGN! A DND CAMPAIGN!

Facing down the craggy facade of the mountain path, the party set off. The path, while poorly aged and abused by nature, was easy enough to climb. Signs of humanity don't stop at the tracks and trails, however; a cart is found, overturned and derelict. Upon inspection, the party finds signs of an attack: arrows embedded deep into the wood. Cautious, one steps forward, Idris, who investigates the boxes and finds them worth scavenging. Altogether, the party finds an elven-craft dagger and a golden ring with beautiful blood-red stones. Proceeding, not much time passes before the mountain once again throws something along their path. A golem of sorts: a galeb duhr, a stone construct of magic that is set to protect a sacred space of magical flow. This space is revealed to be a druid circle, which allows for closer connection to the magic of the weave and the energy of the natural world. Through the combined efforts of Idris and Monikin, several tablets are copied and translated. Afterwards, these tablets are recognized as a type of oracle by Melian; they allow one to talk to the gods, or maybe even the weave itself. The party stores this for the future. Following this, they make it to the mountaintop town of Kalnassalnos, a town caught between two empires, yet under the jurisdiction of none. They inquire about the town, empires, and world from a priest to Set Velanos, Tsiit Zhonwupek. He offers them blessings and shelter. The party also inquires about armaments and supplies from the village elder, Vasilescu Lacusta. Night passes. The next morning, they set down the other side of the mountain, coming into conflict with the animals and even terrain of the untrained wilds. At the base, they rest. This rest, however, is interrupted as several jackalweres see and attempt to engage the party.

This ends poorly for the combatants who are defeated before they even get close enough to attack. Seems preparation wasn't their forte. Finally, as the sun begins to set, the party crosses the thin stretch of desert before Mivwe'en and finds an inn to rest. _**BUT THAT'S JUST A CAMPAIGN!

Thanks to the work of the Maesters at the college of magic, the party was able to utilize their crystal to teleport back to the Swordcoast. However, the magic that links the stone between the two worlds had dimmed, so it was going to be a one-way journey. Furthermore, the magic would be low-fidelity, meaning the party could appear anywhere in a large range. Knowing these risks, and relying on the bonds they had forged, the party leapt into this new unknown. While they had hoped for adventure, they did not expect it to come so quickly. They landed on their feet in a town beset by smoke and fire - a dragon wheeling overhead. Before they could process, a woman defending her family slipped from between two buildings, fending off a pack of Kobolds. The party stepped in to help the woman, Lilan Swift, and learned of a coordinated attack on the city comprised of the dragon overhead and various forces on the ground. The only safety was the keep. Cautiously, the party moved through the chaos, encountering two enemy parties along the way. Deftly, Elva cast invisibility on Idris, allowing him to spy on these hooded figures. He learned of a name, "Tiamat," as well as their plan to amass treasure. Additionally, there were hints of a power structure - or maybe only conflict in the ranks. Moving forward, several other survivors are found. Upon reaching the keep, they find it barred. Concordia and Idris followed the advice of one of the survivors and headed to a drain tunnel which should lead into the keep. Upon busting a hole through which the two halflings could fit, they found themselves avoiding rats and shouting to an unbending guard through a locked wooden trapdoor. At this time, enemies spotted those waiting outside the keep. The party slammed on the door and finally got attention. Here, Lilan spoke up and gained the trust of the keep to open the door. Rallying, the party and two survivors fought back the enemies until everyone could evacuate into the keep.

Here, they convinced the dwarf leader of the guard, Escobert, to unlock the trap door and allow their halfling companions in. Following this, the party met with Governor Nighthill and informed him of what they had learned, earning them new jobs. Turns out, a group of adventurers was exactly what might've been hoped for to deal with the menace of the dragon. Undella, hearing of these spontaneous heroes, decided to join for a bit of fun. Up on the parapet, wishing to avoid direct conflict, Elva shouted a request to the dragon. The dragon, surprisingly, acquiesced to conversation and bartering began. The dragon agreed to leave if a unique item could be offered for it to add to its horde. Pandering to its greed, a drawing of Elva's lizard, Talith, drawn by Melian was offered. This successfully won the dragon's favor and shocked all the townsfolk in the process. With praise, more requests were added. The Governor wished them to investigate two particularly concerning fires - one threatening their mill and grain stores, the other their sanctuary and possibly many common folk. The party chose to investigate the sanctuary, a chapel to Chauntea. They exited at the river and snuck to the low-rise wall around the chapel. Idris again scouted ahead. The chapel had been surrounded and the refugees inside were being smoked out. The party devised a plan to scare the cultists at the front and evacuate those inside. Hoping to quell any panic, Idris and Undella snuck through the belltower of the chapel to warn those inside of what was to come. Upon informing Eadyan Falconmoon, the plan commenced outside. Using their spells, Elva and Monikin coordinated to mimic the attacks of a dragon, killing the leader for the group and scaring off the others. Melian opened the front door and took point in leading the evacuation. (edited)

Knowing they were being followed, Elva and Monikin held back to once again utilize their imaginary dragon. A red dragon wyrmling that spat fire would do. It was enough to hold back and intimidate their enemies for a moment. Upon finding it was a ruse, Elva and Monikin led those chasing them through a wild-goose-chase, ultimately hiding. Later, they snuck their way back to the keep, disguised. _**BUT THAT'S JUST A CAMPAIGN! A DND CAMPAIGN!**_ _Thanks for playing..._ (edited)
